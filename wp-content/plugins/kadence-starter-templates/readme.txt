Build a Beautiful "performance optimized" website with ease.

== Description ==

= BUILD A BEAUTIFUL "PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED" WEBSITE WITH EASE =

Create and customize professionally designed websites in minutes with content already tailored to you through the help of AI.

Kadence Starter Templates gives you AI powered starter templates that have images and text generated for your specific site. Each AI powered template is optimized for performance, accessibility and built using the WordPress Block editor.

Unlike other website starter templates that are difficult to change fonts and colors, our ai powered templates are built on a globally linked color palette and font selector. This allows you to change the color scheme or font on your entire website with a few mouse clicks.

Simply setup your business profile, choose your template, choose your colors and fonts, and import. Done!

Kadence Starter Templates using the Kadence Theme for all the designs. 

Why the Kadence Theme? 

**Header/Footer Builder** - Unlike other themes, the Kadence Theme comes with a drag and drop header/footer builder. This allows unlimited design possibilities.

**Globally Linked Color Palette** - The color of element on your website is linked to a global color palette. Want to change a color, change it in one place and the color changes across your entire website.

**Globally Linked Fonts** - Like with the color system, the same goes for your font choices. Want to change a font, change it in one place and the font changes across your entire website. 

**WooCommerce Integration** - The Kadence Theme features the most advanced WooCommerce integration to allow you to: customize your WooCommerce product pages, has a flyout cart, cart icon in header, product page bullet points, my account page customizations, and more.

**Nothing Held Back** - Where other free themes stop, the Kadence Theme holds nothing back.
